1.	I want to be able to know who and where new information submissions for planets are coming from so that I can verify that they are credible sources.
2.	I want to be able to create a new category of information for planets when someone submits data that does not have a category yet.
3.	I want to easily solve GitHub merge conflicts automatically without ruining the data.
4.	I want to have an automatic conversion for units of measurements that I input so that the data is consistent among the catalog.
5.	I want to be able to have an auto-spell checker so that I don’t have to manually re-edit any changes.
6.	I want to have a dynamic fill form for star and planet submissions so that I can easily enter the data into the catalog.
7.	I want to automatically get updates from other verified catalogs to update OEC.
8.	I want to be able to reject a new planet and not get prompted about it again if it’s updated on a different catalog.

10.	I want to get updates from other catalogs on a daily basis.
