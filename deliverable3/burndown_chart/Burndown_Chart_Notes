Sprint 1
	Due to midterms and reajusting stories after receiving feedback for d2 at the TA meeting, we met up and redesigned our plan. In order to stay on track with completing the project, a majority of this week's sprint plan was adjusted to be completed this weekend.

	Changes:
		-remove story 1
		-story 2 cost 8 to 10
		-back end of functions written in python instead of shell as originally planned
