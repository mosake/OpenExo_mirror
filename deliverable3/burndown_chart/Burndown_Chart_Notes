Burndown chart comments:
	
Sprint 1
	Due to midterms and reajusting stories after receiving feedback for d2 at the TA meeting, we met up and redesigned our plan. In order to stay on track with completing the project, a majority of this week's sprint plan was adjusted to be completed this weekend.

	Changes:
		-remove story 1
		-story 2 cost 8 to 10
		-back end of functions written in python instead of shell as originally planned

Sprint 2 and 3
	Reoragnization after TA meeting
	Henry found a resource that made Kelly's task during sprint 2 unnessisary (csv conversion from exoplanet.eu) but Kelly already spent dev hours working on it. ;-;

	Dennis' task taking longer than expected (3) - expected 8sp
	Kelly's task taking longer than expected (3)
	User story completion NOT ACCOMPLISHED IN THI SPRINT, to be accomplished in next sprint
		due to clairification with client:
			Story 7 taking an extremely unexpectedly long amount of time
			Heavy courseload for some members, burndown expected to be negligable this sprint

	Story 5 + 6 complete [2]
	tasks carried over to next sprint

Sprint 4
	Story point reassignment becoming major issue

	due to clairification with client:
		Story 7 took an extremely unexpectedly long amount of time
		Story 8 removed
	Story 4,7,8 (formerly 9) complete

	Code freeze on the 12th for code review session
