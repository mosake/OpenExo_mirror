Name of reviewer: Kelly Mo
Code under review: Automatic Pull (xmlPull.py)
Date of Review: November 12, 2016
Code Author: Dennis Tra

Checked:
	format - not PEP8
	style - variables are defined at the start of the code/segment of code (for loop, if statment, etc)
		error try-except is covered
	naming conventions - function comments and variables are fine
	unit tests - The following inputs passed as expected:
			Exisiting in Hanno's repo
			"11 Com"
			Not exisiting in repo
			"38 Vir"
			Case sensitive
			"11 com"
			No seperator
			"11Com"
			Extra seperators
			"11  Com"
			Wrong seperator
			"11_Com"

Summary:
1) Poor Coding Style:
- Does not follow PEP8 standards

2) Code Logic:
- No implementation of pulling all files
