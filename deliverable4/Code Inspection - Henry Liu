Code Inspection
	-Reviewer: Dennis Tra

	-Code under review: translate_ExoPlanet.py, translate_NASA.py, xmltools.py
  
Categories:
	-Bugs:
      -When running translate_NASA, you seem to be setting the output name to the Extracted_XMLs folder (On line 46 of translate_NASA). When running the code nothing appears in this folder.
  
  -Poor code logic:
      -If URL for Nasa database or Exoplanet.eu is down “FileNotFoundError” is raised. In the except statement on line 35 of translate_ExoPlanet.py just raise an error to let the user know the URL is not reachable. 
	
  -Poor coding style:
      -Code not in compliance with PEP8 standards. Run code through PEP8 style check and fix accordingly.
	
  -Missing documentation:
      -Function documentation? What is get() in translate_ExoPlanet.py getting? Same for other functions. Write docstring for functions.
	
  -Unreadable code:
      -Lots of “QUESTION” comments left in code. Found throughout translate_ExoPlanet.py. Get clarification from either TA or Hano to answer those questions.
      -Commented out chunks of code present. Found throughout translate_ExoPlanet.py and translate_NASA.py. Either delete or use the code. 
	
  -Vulnerabilities in code
      -If column names are changed, it appears you will need to manually go through code and change accordingly.
