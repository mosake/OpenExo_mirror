2) Introduce the team members:       28 out of 30

   I am assuming 5 members. If your team has four members,
   scale accordingly.

   for each member:
      approx 150 words: 1/1, 1/1, 1/1, 1/1, 0/1
      spelling and grammar: 1/1, 1/1, 1/1, 1/1, 1/1

   The members' introductions are consistent w.r.t. person (in
   first/third person), style, qualities/interests described, etc., so
   that the overall introduction reads well:      4/5
    - One biography was not like the others!
