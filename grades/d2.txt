CSCC01 Deliverable 2 Marking Guide
-----------------------------------

T25 Jelly
TOTAL: 78/100

Personas:  13 / 20

  Format:  2 / 4

      must contain: gender, age, personality, skills, environment,
      attitude towards technology in general, attitude towards
      computer software, goals when using the system

      Too many irrelevant details are not useful!

      * Missing gender, age, environment

  Information content:  5 / 8

      The purpose of each persona is clear. Personas suggest different
      system requirements.

      * Should not contain details that belong in user stories.
      * Anne missing ability with version control software.

  Coverage: 6 / 8

      personas must include at least two of the following type of users:

      -- "Hanno type"

      -- Hanno's grad student: can approve modifications to the data,
           but cannot add other such users (only Hanno can)

      -- A less tech-savvy astronomer: Sure, Hanno is the client who
           makes the order, but the software will be released as
           open-source, so other types of users are 100% realistic.

      * Should include persona of tech savvy student working under Hanno.

Product Backlog:  39 / 50

     10 / 10 : User stories follow the format
                "As __name__ (__role__), I want __something__."
		("so that __benefit__" is optional)
	       AND each __name__ corresponds to one of the personas.

      8 / 10 : User stories, together, reflect all the user
    	        requirements (from all prospective users).

     10 / 10 : User stories correspond to actual requirements (no
    	        "invented" features).

     4 / 10 : User stories contain enough information for devs to
                estimate how long it would take to implement it.

     7 / 10 : Each user story addresses one specific requirement (no
                "world peace" stories).
