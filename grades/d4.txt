CSCC01 Deliverable 4 Marking Guide
-----------------------------------

Project Management:  __________ (18/20%)

  Release plan: 2/3
    * Please include all releases, even the ones that have passed. -1
      * Include sum-total of story costs.
    - each release corresponds to end of Sprint
    - project fully laid out:
      for each release date, list of user stories to implement
    - project velocity specified and used
    - highest priority user stories first modulo dependencies
    - reasonable goals for each release

  Product Backlog: 2/3
    * Need to include all stories, not just ones left to implement. -1
    * [D3] Stories still need some polishing.
    - user stories follow the correct format.
    - user stories, together, reflect all the user requirements (from
      all personas).
    - user stories correspond to actual requirements (no "invented"
      features).
    - user stories contain enough information for devs to estimate how
      long it would take to implement it.
    - each user story addresses one specific requirement (no "world
      peace" stories).

  Sprint Backlog(s): 2/2
     * [D3] Need to give backklog and plan seperate sections.
     - user stories taken from the Product Backlog
     - estimated costs
     - estimated values

  Sprint Plan(s): 3/3
    - user stories divided into tasks when appropriate.
    - each Sprint Plan contains all the necessary information:
        who is working on which task on which day
    - sum of costs of user stories in the sprint = project velocity
    - good planning decisions

  Use of Task Board: 2/2
    - correct format of task boards
    - snapshots in the begginning and end of each Sprint are provided

  Use of Burndown Charts: 3/3
    - snapshots in the begginning and end of each Sprint are provided
    - correctness of burndown charts

  Use of Repo: 2/2
      (including good use of branching from now on!)

  Use of communication tools: 2/2
     - evidence of using communication tools of their choice effectively


Design and Implementation:  __________ (16/30%)

   System Design: 3/5
      * Need more focus on components of actual system, not 3rd party
        components -1.
      * Need more details on relevant components to determine if design is
        modular -1
      - good modular design
      - general and easy to extend
      - it is clear how the current implementation is going to be
        extended into an application that satisfies the client's needs

   Implementation: 5/10
    * Critical bug: -2
      * No file or directory 'extracted/Exoplanet_data/Exoplanet_archive_updated.csv'
      * I've tried this on two platforms and all have this issue!
      * Location: translate_ExoPlanet.parse()
      * Cause: get() seems to fail, and fails silently due to try-catch!
    * Incompleted/untested features. -2
    * No README on how to setup/run. -1
     - 0 marks if it doesn't run
     - most of the features are either fully implemented of nearly implemented
     - quality and maturity of code


Verification and Validation:  __________ (12/25%)

  - quality of unit tests: 2/10
    * No unit tests found, only manual testing (test xml files) -8
    - good coverage
    - no redundancy

  - code review activities and outcomes: 5/10
    * Inconsistent formatting/checklist -1
    * Reviews need to be more thorough (for some). -1
      * Bugs, unreadable code, confusing code, etc etc
      * Location, and suggestions for fixing?
    * No evidence of actions taken. -1
    * Meeting video isn't a presentation, needs to be a conversation. -2
      * Note suggestions given during meeting for D4.
    - each review follows a checklist (not necessarily the example one, but the
      same checklist for all)
    - each review is thorough
    - evidence of addressing the outcomes of the review
    - the video demonstrates an effective process used for the review/collection
      meeting

  - validation activities and outcomes: 5/5
    * Good
    - evidence of feedback from the user
    - evidence of addressing feedback from the user
