Administration
	TA questions email
	Marking – meeting + interviews
	Interview – meeting but marked
	Feature implemented by person A – everyone should know what it does, completed/incomplete, memorizing the technical coding not needed, no technical questions
Advice:
	Communicate b/w what’s being implemented, progress reports
		Why’d you implement this, x way?
		Why is this late? Not completed?
		I don’t know is the worst possible answer
		Most technical: what is the design pattern used behind this feature?
	Deliverable
		Git – master branch vs sub branches
		Conflict when everyone pushes to same branch (master)
		Personal branches for each user + merge to master
		Resolve in person
		Commit message formats
	Offline
		Accessible to everyone through internet
		Front end? Database? Web app? Android?
		Back end? Server?
	Contingencies 
		Contact? Wait next day? Majority vote?
		Small as possible response time
