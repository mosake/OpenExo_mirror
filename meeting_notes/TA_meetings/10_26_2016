TA Meeting notes

Man page problem - ongoing updates with new functions added, will not be completed in one sprint

SP - new based on how long it took to execute

Which stories to put into sprint backlog

Back end connect to software files
	expand
	components of application for diagram
		module to communicate with git
			format of pull requests
		know "why I need this component"

Update:
	save last date run into text file for pull query

more hours for next sprint
	more research instead of development

merge may be more complicated than expected (warning)
	merge story is an epic, split up into at least 5 stories

Talk to Ryan

Get script to download from online
	** don't get users to instal git, find a library from python that can execute it directly

	or get user to install git as a component
